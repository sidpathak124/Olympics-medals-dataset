# Olympics-medals-dataset
Here we are going to analyse the Olympics medals dataset for all the medals 
that have been awarded in both summer and winter Olympic games.

Questions that we would be answering are:

Which are the top performing Countries?
Do GDP, Population and Politics of a country affect its performance? (Hypothesis testing also done)
Does Geographical location matter?
Do culture and religion matter?
